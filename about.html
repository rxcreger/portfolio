          <p class="about-intro">My path to UX wasn't a direct one, but a series of steps in the right direction.</p>
          <p>From a young age, I loved drawing, painting and making things with my hands. The thing I loved the most was fashion design, and I was always borrowing costume history books from the library and sketching out scenes where everyone was wearing elaborate Victorian gowns. At age 16, I was moved to tears while watching the 2007 Chistian Dior Haute Couture Spring fashion show online. The theme was inspired by the Madame Butterfly Opera with sculptural origami gowns, dramatic music and rotating stages creating a highly emotional experience. I was blown away by the combination of art, design and showmanship and it helped me realize I wanted to pursue a creative path of study in college.</p>
          <br><br><p>I didn’t feel fashion was a viable career path, so I decided to go to a four year university instead of a fashion school. I started as a fine arts major but my curious and analytical mind left me wanting something more. Along this line of inquiry I switched to a design major at UC Davis, excited to combine aesthetics and messaging. I loved the design program at UC Davis, and it permanently changed how I think about creativity to a problem solving mindset. My design school was focused on print work, and I came to appreciate the power of visual messages, typefaces and branding. But it didn’t ignite a desire in me to create those things. I wanted to create more written content, and nudging pixels around on a screen wasn’t enough for me. I loved design but didn’t know how I wanted to fit into the design world.</p>

        <section class="bio-part-2">
          <p>After college I worked as a community manager at 99designs, a two sided marketplace where clients come to work with graphic designers from all over the world. I was brought in to create educational materials for designers who hadn’t had the benefit of a formal design education like I had, which involved writing design tutorial blog posts. I took to this challenge well, enjoying the process of researching and teaching through writing. I came to care deeply about this community of designers, and felt inspired to advocate for them and help them succeed on the platform. After years of conveying designers feedback and concerns to product so they could be prioritized in combination with business goals I realized that I wanted it to be my job to design the changes our users were asking for. Redesigning their environment could have such a larger effect at scale on improving their lives more than any single webinar, meetup or personalized postcard. As I got to work cross functionally with our product, design and engineering teams to build better experiences for designers I wanted to update my design skills so I could become a UX designer and help improve people’s lives. I completed Bloc’s Product design program, where I found my passion for creating user-centered experiences that solve everyday problems for people.
