                         <p>Through our research we discovered our users wanted to shop local and support small businesses more often. Common barriers for them were the convenience of online shopping and the difficulty of discovering products locally. Other concerns were shopping safely in person during a pandemic, which is making them shop online even more.</p>

                  <p>To find an opportunity for an e-commerce platform to compete in the marketplace, I conducted a competitive analysis on four e-commerce apps: Amazon,  Etsy and Google Shopping.

              <br>
              <p>Some do allow users to shop locally, but none of them are featuring truly independent retailers, just big box stores or individual sellers. There’s also an opportunity for small independent retailers to complete in this climate where even large e-commerce platforms aren’t as reliable because of the disruption to their supply chains during this pandemic.</p>

We used this list to decide on the brand name Local Gems, a common phrase to describe small businesses, and one that would tell new users what our platform is about: shopping locally for quality products at small businesses online. Brand characteristics are friendly, fun, premium, hip, handmade, locally made, artisan, artsy crafty, slick, modern, warm, diverse, and inclusive.</p>

                <p>I also received feedback from all users that they’d like to see the stores on a map to see how close they are to them and that they were interested in learning more about each shop. To help users achieve these goals, I went back to the drawing board and created a map feature on the homepage which would show the shops nearby on a map and link to a corresponding landing page for each shop which would showcase their products and tell users more about each shop.:</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Overall, we had a lot of success with a “product-first” approach to the design. Users are looking or products first, not shops, and discovering local businesses is a benefit that happens further down the funnel. I learned the important of including as much relevant information as possible throughout the purchasing experience, because our users are very savvy when it comes to online shopping and need to feel we’re trustworthy and that they have enough information to make a decision to purchase. For example, I thought it would be enough to show that products were within 5 miles in their city of choice, but user feedback highlighted the importance of showing exactly how far away each product was from them so they could decide whether to order the item for delivery or walk across the street for curbside pickup. I learned that users want shopping local to be easy, and to highlight the local aspect of the shopping experience.<br>

                     One of the most challenging and enjoyable aspects of the problem was deciding how to filter through just how much rich data we got from our research. There’s a lot of diversity in how people shop online vs shopping locally and we knew we had to provide a lot of flexibility for people to use the platform in different way. I initially thought that a platform allowing people to shop locally for curbside pickup would be sufficient, but a lot of respondents in the survey made it clear that the ability to order items for delivery would tempt them to shop locally more often. Other respondents preferred shipping locally in person, and wanted to use an app like this to check which items were in stock and go look at the item in person.<br>

                     Since one of the purposes of this app is to help users discover local shops, and some feedback I got was to show the shops’ locations on a map feature. All my mvp high priority user stories had been tested and validated but the feedback convinced me that showing store’s on a map and showing more information about each store was essential to making this product succeed by making each shop seem more real and compelling to users. In the end, I believe adding this feature paid off.<br>

                     Another problem I’d like to address if I had more time is the small business side of this marketplace. I choose to go the customer-facing route for the time being but a platform like this needs to solve problems like inventory and payment processing for small business owners as well and it’s something I’d like to research and test if I had more time.
