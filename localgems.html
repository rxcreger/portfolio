                         <p>Through our research I discovered our users wanted to shop local and support small businesses more often. Common barriers for them were the convenience of online shopping and the difficulty of discovering products locally. Other concerns were shopping safely in person during a pandemic, which makes them them shop local less often.</p>

              <h4>User Survey Analysis</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Based on the findings I realized I needed to build an e-commerce platform that shows which items are in stock nearby and offers both pickup and delivery options. I initially assumed that only offering pickup options for shopping local would be enough, but the research showed users wanted delivery options as well. One surprising thing I found was that while users shop online on both mobile and desktop devices, they tend to use mobile devices for browsing and desktop devices for making the actual purchase. Because of this, I decided to design both mobile and desktop versions but decided to prioritize the desktop version in user testing to simulate the likely purchasing experience. When I learned about users’ motivations for shopping local, I knew I had to create a premium brand experience and product offerings to appeal to their desire to support local businesses, find unique or handmade items or to see merchandise in-person.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>To find an opportunity for an e-commerce platform to compete in the marketplace, I conducted a competitive analysis on three e-commerce apps used most often by our survey respondents: Amazon, Etsy and Google Shopping. All of them include features that allow you to shop local, but the experience leaves much to be desired:</p>

              <br>
              <p>Though many of our respondents use those apps, their shop local features are hard to find and organize information in a confusing way. None of them feature local, independent shops, just big box stores or individual sellers. My research showed that users want to shop local and support independent stores more often, but find it hard to do so because of the convenience of e-commerce and safety concerns surrounding the pandemic. I found there was an opportunity for a  an e-commerce platform to compete if it included features that:</p>

              <p>As trends in my research emerged, I conducted follow-up interviews with respondents to better understand their survey responses and learn more about their shopping preferences. This helped me craft personas that fell into three categories: those who prefer shopping local to e-commerce, those who are evenly split between the two, and those who rarely shop local and do the majority of their shipping online.</p>

                   <h4>User testing high fidelity prototypes</h4>
                   <br>
                   <p>I user tested the high fidelity desktop prototype on three users to complete these tasks:
                   </p>
                   <br><br>
                   <ol>
                      <li>Browse for and filter different categories of products</li>
                      <li>Search for an item</li>
                      <li>Order an item for delivery</li>
                      <li>Order an item for pickup</li>
                   </ol>
                   <br><br>
                   <p>Users were able to understand what the app was about and complete the tasks of browsing through categories and purchasing items for delivery. There was a little confusion about which items were available for pickup vs delivery on the product details page, so I updated the designs for the icons and included more information about how far away each shop was:</p>
                </article>
                <div class="lg-user-testing-container">
                  <div class="lg-before">
                    <p>Before</p>
                    <img src="images/localgems/Product-details-planter1.png" alt="hifi user testing1" class="lg-user-testing-images">
                  </div>
                  <div class="lg-after">
                    <p>After</p>
                    <img src="images/localgems/Product-details-planter2.png" alt="hifi user testing2" class="lg-user-testing-images">
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Users expressed some confusion about the organization of the confirmation page and wanted more information regarding their order, so I moved the “Keep Shopping” button to the right, added an order confirmation number and directions to the shop if they were ordering for pickup. </p>
                <div class="lg-user-testing-container">
                  <div class="lg-before">

                   <h4>Further testing and refinements/Adding a new map feature</h4>
                   <br>
                   <p>I also received feedback from all users that they’d like to see the stores on a map to see how close they are to them and that they were interested in learning more about each shop. To help users achieve these goals, I went back to the drawing board and created a map feature on the homepage which would show the shops nearby on a map and link to a corresponding landing page for each shop which would showcase their products and tell users more about each shop:</p>
                </article>
                <div class="preference-testing-images">
                  <div class="lg-before">
                    <p class="lg-changes-made">New map feature that shows nearby shops and links to shop landing pages:</p>
                    <img src="images/localgems/map-feature.png"  alt="preference testing1" class="lg-user-testing-images">
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Next, I user tested the map feature: users were able to discover shops nearby on a map, learn more about each store and browse their products. But they seemed to expect to be able to filter their results had some additional suggestions like adding a “Your are here” location marker, filtering and sorting to to the map, and item categories to the shop landing pages.</p>

                   <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                   <br>
                   <p>Overall, I had a lot of success with a “product-first” approach to the design. Users are looking for products first, not shops, and discovering local businesses is a benefit that happens further down the funnel. I learned the important of including as much relevant information as possible throughout the purchasing experience, because our users are very savvy when it comes to online shopping and need to feel we’re trustworthy and that they have enough information to make a decision to purchase. For example, I thought it would be enough to show that products were within 5 miles in their city of choice, but user feedback highlighted the importance of showing exactly how far away each product was from them so they could decide whether to order the item for delivery or walk across the street for curbside pickup. I learned that users want shopping local to be easy, and to highlight the local aspect of the shopping experience.<br>

                     <br>One of the most challenging and enjoyable aspects of the problem was deciding how to filter through just how much rich data I got from our research. There’s a lot of diversity in how people shop online vs shopping locally and I knew I had to provide a lot of flexibility for people to use the platform in different way. I initially thought that a platform allowing people to shop locally for curbside pickup would be sufficient, but a lot of respondents in the survey made it clear that the ability to order items for delivery would tempt them to shop locally more often. Other respondents preferred shipping locally in person, and wanted to use an app like this to check which items were in stock and go look at the item in person.<br>

                     Since one of the purposes of this app is to help users discover local shops, and some feedback I got was to show the shops’ locations on a map feature. All my mvp high priority user stories had been tested and validated but the feedback convinced me that showing store’s on a map and showing more information about each store was essential to making this product succeed by making each shop seem more real and compelling to users. In the end, I believe adding this feature paid off.<br>

                     <br>Another problem I’d like to address if I had more time is the small business side of this marketplace. I choose to go the customer-facing route for the time being but a platform like this needs to solve problems like inventory and payment processing for small business owners as well and it’s something I’d like to research and test if I had more time.
